          <h3>Quick Guide how to use this site</h3>
          <div class="guide-content">
            <p>This website is designed as an exploratory analytical tool. Users can examine how solar installations and public subsidies are distributed across space, time, and income context by interacting with the dashboard components.</p>

            <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1: Start with the map</strong>
              <p>Begin with the interactive map to view solar installations and subsidy totals by ZIP code. The map provides a spatial overview and helps identify broad geographic patterns.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 2: Use filters to define scope</strong>
              <p>Use filters to limit the data by time period, subsidy program, or installation characteristics. This allows controlled comparisons between different subsets of the data.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 3: Examine capacity and spending together</strong>
              <p>Compare solar capacity and public spending side by side. Capacity reflects the scale of installations, while spending reflects public financial support. Viewing both together helps distinguish between many small projects and fewer large ones.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 4: Add income context</strong>
              <p>Enable income or demographic overlays to place installations and subsidies in context. These indicators describe ZIP-code–level characteristics and are intended for comparative analysis, not individual assessment.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 5: Compare across places or time</strong>
              <p>Switch between ZIP codes or adjust time filters to compare patterns across locations or periods. This supports questions about how distributions change or persist.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 6: Inspect definitions and assumptions</strong>
              <p>Use the built-in documentation panels to review definitions, data sources, and known limitations. These notes are integral to interpreting the results correctly.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 7: Share or cite views</strong>
              <p>Each configured view can be shared using a stable link. This enables reproducibility for reporting, teaching, or further analysis.</p>
            </li>
            </ol>
 
            <p>The tool is intended for:</p>

            <h3>Low-income solar programs</h3>
            <p>
              This section focuses on California solar incentive programs explicitly designed for low-income households and communities. These programs are highlighted separately because they have clear eligibility criteria, well-documented funding structures, and can be consistently linked to income context at the ZIP-code level.
            </p>

            <p>The programs included in this section are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>SASH (Single-family Affordable Solar Homes)</strong><br>Incentives that help low-income households install solar on single-family homes by reducing upfront installation costs.</li>
              <li><strong>DAC-SASH (Disadvantaged Communities – SASH)</strong><br>A variant of SASH targeted at state-designated disadvantaged communities, supporting solar installations in areas facing higher economic and environmental burdens.</li>
              <li><strong>MASH (Multifamily Affordable Solar Housing)</strong><br>Incentives for affordable multifamily housing, where solar benefits can be shared by multiple low-income residents.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These programs are state-supported, installation-linked, and can be tied to specific projects and locations, making them suitable for geographic and income-based comparison.</p>

            <p>
              This section does not imply that all subsidies in the dataset are low-income programs. Other state or utility incentive programs may also appear elsewhere in the data when they can be linked to individual solar installations, regardless of income targeting. This panel is a focused subset, not a comprehensive list of all subsidies.
